#JavaScript (ECMAScript6) MultiConversion Countdown Timer, experimental

The App converts the current countdown time into binary or roman numeral format.
1 unit (hour, minute, second,...) represents one binary/roman number. 
The Countdown app is based on previous project (Multiconversion Clock) replaced with a Countdown class.

The User Interface is the table itself with eventlisteners, it's kind of a "Binary Abacus". By clicking in the
cells the bin values will be added per timeunit, deadding doesn't work (buggy) => reset.
